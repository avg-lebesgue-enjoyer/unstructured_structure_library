# Purpose
This exists for me to:
- Understand how to implement and operate on data structures at a low level
- Practice writing in C
- Tick this off the *Computer Science student bucket list*

This is being shared publically for others' benefit. **I encourage you to write something like this on your own before looking through mine.**

# Changelog

### 2024-06-20_20-40
- [# Progress](#progress) now exists. I'm afraid of setting my scope too large, so I might reduce it in the future (in particular, I might get rid of "stuff that just doesn't need to be here, really" like "map via unsorted list (ew)")
- `.gitignore` now exists (yes I'm stupid, no don't fire me)

### 2024-06-19_18-00
- `main.c` now exists
- `main.h` also exists, with rudimentary documentation
- I now understand how to structure files in subdirectories etc.
- Copied over `2023-10-14_13-00_Algos_Datas_Summary.pdf`
- Wtf is a makefile? ig I know now

### 2024-06-19_16-16
- Spawned in
