# Purpose
This exists for me to:
- Understand how to implement and operate on data structures at a low level
- Practice writing in C
- Tick this off the *Computer Science student bucket list*

This is being shared publically for others' benefit. **I encourage you to write something like this on your own before looking through mine.**
